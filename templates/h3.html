            <h1>Healthy Lifestyle & Preventive Measures</h1>
            <p>Living a <strong>healthy lifestyle</strong> is one of the best ways to prevent heart disease and improve overall well-being. Small, consistent changes in diet, physical activity, and mental health can have a profound effect on reducing the risk of developing heart-related conditions. It's never too late to adopt healthier habits, and even incremental changes can make a significant difference over time.</p>

            <p>First and foremost, <strong>maintaining a balanced diet</strong> is critical. Consuming a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help reduce risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. Reducing the intake of trans fats, saturated fats, and high-sugar foods is also key to keeping the heart healthy. A heart-healthy diet promotes healthy cholesterol levels, regulates blood sugar, and provides the nutrients needed to support cardiovascular function.</p>

            <p>Another crucial aspect of a healthy lifestyle is <strong>regular physical activity</strong>. Exercise helps to strengthen the heart, improve blood circulation, and manage body weight. Cardiovascular exercises such as walking, running, cycling, or swimming can help lower blood pressure, reduce bad cholesterol levels, and increase good cholesterol levels (HDL). The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise, along with strength training on two or more days per week.</p>

            <p><strong>Quitting smoking</strong> is one of the most important preventive measures for heart health. Smoking damages blood vessels and decreases the amount of oxygen delivered to the heart, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. If you smoke, quitting can significantly reduce the risk of these diseases and improve overall health. There are many resources available to help people quit smoking, including counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and support groups.</p>

            <p><strong>Stress management</strong> is also vital for a heart-healthy lifestyle. Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks. Finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as through relaxation techniques, meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or spending time outdoors, can significantly reduce the impact of stress on heart health. It's also essential to make time for hobbies and activities that bring joy and relaxation, helping to maintain emotional well-being.</p>

            <p>Finally, <strong>getting enough sleep</strong> plays a major role in heart health. Poor sleep habits, such as sleep deprivation or sleep disorders like sleep apnea, can increase the risk of heart disease. Aim for 7 to 9 hours of quality sleep each night to allow the body and heart to rest and recover. A good sleep routine, such as setting a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine late in the day, and creating a relaxing bedtime environment, can improve sleep quality and benefit heart health.</p>
